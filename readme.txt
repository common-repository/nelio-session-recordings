== Description ==

**PLAYBACK YOUR VISITORS ACTIVITY RECORDINGS LIKE A VIDEO THAT YOU CAN WATCH**

[Nelio Session Recordings](https://neliosoftware.com/session-recordings/?utm_source=wordpressorg&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=nelio-session-recordings) helps you watch recordings of real user behavior on your site, including mouse movements, clicks, scroll events, and more. Learn what frustrates users and resolve issues early.

Automatically record everything your visitors do on your website. The sessions can be replayed, rewatched, and analyzed later. You can see exactly what they see, just like you’re sitting next to them.

Watch a replay of people navigating your website to see what’s preventing them from converting. See how people interacted with products, what they added to cart, and what kept them from buying.

**Nelio Session Recordings** is a great solution for UX designers, marketing professionals, customer support teams, and everyone who works with websites.

= What are sessions? =

A session is a visitor’s full journey on your site, including every page they visit. Every time a visitor comes to your site, we’ll record their journey and how they interact with your page.

- Understand how customers browse your site.
- Identify where they’re getting stuck.
- Make quick changes that directly impact revenue.

Not to brag, but we have a LOT of expertise around [conversion rate optimization!](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nelio-ab-testing/)

= Will recordings slow down my website? =

Nope! Our frontend scripts won’t slow down site speed or performance for your visitors or customers.
